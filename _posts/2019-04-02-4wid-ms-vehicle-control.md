Does four-wheel steering bring additional maneuverability benefits when used with four-wheel driving and drive-by-wire technology? Our answer is a big YES.

### Abstract

Electric vehicles are capable of more flexible drivetrain configurations, such that driving dynamics of each wheel could be controlled independently to increase its stability and maneuverability bounds. We hereby propose a configuration consisting of four wheel independent driving and front and rear axle modular steering. The vehicle implements drive-by-wire technology, which means the control program running on vehicle control computer will have direct control authority of the vehicle under normal driving conditions, based on inputs of higher level systems such as human drivers and autonomous driving programs. Both the torque allocation on four wheels and the steering allocation on axles are completely independent on the mechanical hardware level, thus the vehicle is able to harness adverse contact conditions with confidence. A slip-aware model-free control method for torque allocation and steering is proposed and inspected in the paper, with digital model of a modified SUV simulated for validation, and the vehicle responses with and without such controller are compared to elaborate its strengths. Such control method has more safety margin under close-to-limits driving conditions with presence of tire slip. The control method along with drive-by-wire features also enhance driving safety by correcting excessive inputs by human drivers. Additionally, a comprehensive index reflecting the stability and maneuverability of the vehicle is also introduced and based on which a model-based controller is designed and compared.
