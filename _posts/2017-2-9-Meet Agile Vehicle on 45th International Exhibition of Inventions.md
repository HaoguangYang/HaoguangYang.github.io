Agile Vehicle is a prototype of the future automobile developed by us. This is a highly-automated road vehicle that take you wherever your destination is in whatever attitude you want.

It is implemented with fancy novel design of the suspension system that allow it to handle rough driving conditions and absorb impacts from all directions. Its complicated dynamic control algorithm is also a highlight of the project, which expanded its degree of freedom and ensured its smoothness in doing fancy maneuverings such as side-slid-in parking, asynchronous steering, and pinpoint steering, and the transition from one mode to another. With automatic driving integrated into the system, I believe it would be a brand new world for the whole automobile industry.
