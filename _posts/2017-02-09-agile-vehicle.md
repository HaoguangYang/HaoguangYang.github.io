### Introduction

In recent years, the electric car industry experienced rapid development. However, the design of electric vehicles in the current market is still based on the traditional structure of the internal combustion engine vehicles, using the traditional transmission and suspension system. This results in low transmission efficiency, heavy weight, high processing costs and other issues so the market potential is impeded.

This invention aims to provide a novel smart electric vehicle. It has completely changed the design of the conventional electric vehicle, provided the driver with an intuitive driving experience, and enhanced energy efficiency significantly. Through abandoning the traditional transmission and suspension system in terms of the mechanical structure, a novel mechanical design of four-wheel independent steering and control system is adopted. On this basis, the control mode of the three-axis stabilization system of the spacecraft is introduced to control the wheel motion by the wheel motor control system. The computer-aided steering mechanism is also developed to realize different driving modes, such as lateral moving mode, and omnidirectional / in-situ steering. The path planning function is applied to move the vehicle according to the planned route.

### Special Features and Advantages

- Increase transmission efficiency;
- Achieve intuitive driving;
- Adopt omnidirectional and fully independent suspension system to realize omnidirectional steering and reduced vibration;
- Adopt normal motor to drive the wheels instead of wheel-hub motor, resulting in less rotational inertia.


### Applications

- Shed light on revolutionary future cars from ground-up.

### Awards

- **Silver Medal of the 45th International Exhibition of Inventions of Geneva**
- First Prize, Open Research for Innovative Challenges, Tsinghua University (China)

### Intellectual Property

- PRC Patent: 201710313082.9; 201610517146.2
