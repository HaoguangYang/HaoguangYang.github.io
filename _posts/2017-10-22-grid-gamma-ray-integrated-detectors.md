### Introduction

![天格计划(GRID: Gamma-Ray Integrated Detectors)](http://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/phy/5288/20170425134239887236446/1493099641841.jpg)

GRID (Gamma-Ray Integrated Detectors) is a constellation of CubeSats in low earth orbit that analyzes up signals of GRBs from deep space. Using CubeSats, massive deployment of state-of-the-art Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) Detectors in orbit is made possible. The detectors form a stereo orientation network that interacts with gravitational wave detectors on high-energy astronomical events. By measuring the time delay of the signal reaching two or more cubesats' detectors, the origin of the GRB is positioned in the sky. With such measurements we would be able to link them with electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources and fill in the blank of high energy astronomy.

abstract={The Gamma-Ray Integrated Detectors (GRID) is a space mission concept dedicated to monitoring the transient gamma-ray sky in the energy range from 10 keV to 2 MeV using scintillation detectors onboard CubeSats in low Earth orbits. The primary targets of GRID are the gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in the local universe. The scientific goal of GRID is, in synergy with ground-based gravitational wave (GW) detectors such as LIGO and VIRGO, to accumulate a sample of GRBs associated with the merger of two compact stars and study jets and related physics of those objects. It also involves observing and studying other gamma-ray transients such as long GRBs, soft gamma-ray repeaters, terrestrial gamma-ray flashes, and solar flares. With multiple CubeSats in various orbits, GRID is unaffected by the Earth occultation and serves as a full-time and all-sky monitor. Assuming a horizon of 200 Mpc for ground-based GW detectors, we expect to see a few associated GW-GRB events per year. With about 10 CubeSats in operation, GRID is capable of localizing a faint GRB like 170817A with a 90{\%} error radius of about 10 degrees, through triangulation and flux modulation. GRID is proposed and developed by students, with considerable contribution from undergraduate students, and will remain operated as a student project in the future. The current GRID collaboration involves more than 20 institutes and keeps growing. On August 29th, the first GRID detector onboard a CubeSat was launched into a Sun-synchronous orbit and is currently under test.},
