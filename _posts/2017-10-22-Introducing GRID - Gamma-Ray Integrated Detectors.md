A team of young and enthusiastic physicists, astronomers, and engineers of Tsinghua University in China, seeking the opportunity of becoming pioneers in multi-messenger astronomy with state-of-the-art Gamma-Ray Burst localizers.

## Introduction

![天格计划(GRID: Gamma-Ray Integrated Detectors)](http://www.phys.tsinghua.edu.cn/publish/phy/5288/20170425134239887236446/1493099641841.jpg)

GRID (Gamma-Ray Integrated Detectors) is a constellation of cubesats in low earth orbit that pick up signals of gamma-ray bursts from deep space and try to localize them by measuring the time delay of the signal reaching two or more cubesats' detectors. With such measurements we would be able to link them with electromagnetic counterparts of gravitational wave sources and fill in the blank of high energy astronomy.

## Personal Contributions

I am mainly involved in affairs related to satellite bus: interface of the payload, heat and power management, etc.
